  description: "I am an ambitious and results-driven AWS DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in designing and managing scalable cloud infrastructures. During my internship at Ghaim, I gained deep expertise in AWS services, Docker, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code, successfully deploying and optimizing applications for high availability and cost-efficiency. My technical skills extend to automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines, managing databases like MongoDB and MySQL, and building secure, resilient environments using AWS VPC, EC2, and RDS. With a strong academic foundation, including a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (graduated with distinction) and currently pursuing a Master's in Computer & Communication Engineering, I am passionate about continuous learning and applying my knowledge to solve real-world challenges. As an IEEE LIU Student Branch Chairman, I led international events, driving innovation and collaboration, and earning recognition for excellence on both national and international levels.",
